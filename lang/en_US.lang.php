// INSTRUCTIONS
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// This file contains all of the strings that are used throughout phpScheduleit.
// Please save the translated file as '2 letter language code'.lang.php.  For example, en.lang.php.
// 
// To make phpScheduleIt available in another language, simply translate each
//  of the following strings into the appropriate one for the language.  If there
//  is no direct translation, please provide the closest translation.  Please be sure
//  to make the proper additions the /config/langs.php file (instructions are in the file).
//  Also, please add a help translation for your language using en.help.php as a base.
//
// You will probably keep all sprintf (%s) tags in their current place.  These tags
//  are there as a substitution placeholder.  Please check the output after translating
//  to be sure that the sentences make sense.
//
// + Please use single quotes ' around all $strings.  If you need to use the ' character, please enter it as \'
// + Please use double quotes " around all $email.  If you need to use the " character, please enter it as \"
//
// + For all $dates please use the PHP strftime() syntax
//    http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php
//
// + Non-intuitive parts of this file will be explained with comments.  If you
//    have any questions, please email lqqkout13@users.sourceforge.net
//    or post questions in the Developers forum on SourceForge
