		<ul>
			<li>Click on “Place a Reservation”.</li>
			<li>You’ll see a grid of times and rooms, starting with the current date.</li>

			<li>Click Save to place your reservation. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><h5>What do the colors on the grid mean?</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Green blocks (with horizontal stripes) indicate reservations that you have placed.</li>
			<li>Red blocks (with vertical stripes) are reservations that others have placed.</li>
			<li>Grey blocks are time slots that are in the past and are no longer available.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><h5>Can I cancel a reservation?</h5>

          times you wish to reserve the selected 
          resource for.</p>
        <p>There will be a message below the time selection informing you of

          is greater than or less than this allowed time, it will not be accepted.</p>
        <p>You can also select if you want to repeat this reservation. To repeat
          a reservation, select the days you want it to repeat on, then select
          the duration you want to have the reservation repeat for. The reservation
          will be made for your initially selected day, plus all the days you
          selected as repeats. All dates that could not be reserved because of
        a reservation conflict will be listed. If you are creating a multi-day
          reservation, the repeat options will not be available.</p>
        <p>You can add a summary of this reservation by filling out the summary
          text box. This summary will then be available for all other users to
          read.</p>        
        <p>After setting correct beginning and ending days/times for the
           reservation and selecting if you want the reservation to repeat, press

           A message will appear if the reservation was not successful, informing
           you of the date(s) that were not successful. If not successful, go
           back and edit the requested times so that they
           do not
           overlap with another
           current

             your 
          reservations. All other reservations will be shown, but will not provide
              a link to edit them.</p>
        <p>To edit a reservation through the scheduler, simply click on the
          reservation you wish to change. This will bring up a pop-up window
          very similar to the Reservation window. You have 2 choices;
          you
          can either modify the starting and ending times of the reservation,
          or you can click the &quot;Delete&quot; check box.
           After making your modifications, press the &quot;Modify&quot; 
          button at the bottom of the form. Your new options will be evaluated
           against current reservations and a message will appear letting you
          know 
          the status of your modification. If you need to change times, go back
           to the modification window and select new times which do not overlap
          
          other reservations. After your reservation has been successfully modified,
           the schedule will automatically refresh. This is required to reload
          
          all reservation information from the database.</p>
        <p>To modify a group of recurring reservations, check the box labeled
        &quot;Update all recurring records in group?&quot;. Any conflicting dates
          will be listed.</p>
        <p>You cannot edit a reservation for a date that has passed.</p>

          at the bottom of the scheduler.</p>
        <p>Jump to any date by entering it in the form at the bottom of the scheduler.</p>
        <p>Bring up a navigational calendar by clicking the &quot;View Calendar&quot; link
          at the bottom of the scheduler. Find your desired date and click on
          it to move the scheduler to that date.</p>
